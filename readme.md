# Project csgoGlow, a 100% FREE and OPEN-SOURCE wallhack for OSX

I have reposted this with new features. This version includes a team glow, and also assigns a different color glow to the enemy with the most kills. It works even if they take over a bot.

**Thanks to @gabsens @e-retailer @aKalisch and @iseekwonderful for their contributions to this project**

### Hello World
if you are newbie and have never use Xcode, go and watch @gabsens’s [Video at Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AefIiBg2HKU)

don't get scammed by people trying to make money off of this hack!

### How to run?
clone it from github and run it with **ROOT**.

### Is it safe?
Maybe, depends on Gaben

### More features?
No! We won't implement aimbot, bunnyhop or other stuff to it. This is just a native CS:GO Wallhack.
I might attempt to impliment no-flash.
